# Cars
Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

- Objective of this project was to clean up a raw data set to produce quality data for further use in machine learning. 

- Data included information on multiple attributes of 12000 cars in csv format. 

- This project was built in Python using Google Colab. 

- Data shape, type, head and tail were explored to get a sense of data. 

- Duplicate rows and rows with missing or null values were removed. 

- Irrelevant columns were dropped and relevant ones were renamed for ease of use. 

- Descriptive stats, boxplots and interquartile range were used to detect and remove outliers. 

- Bar graphs, grouping, ANOVA, scatter plots, regression plots, heat map, box plots, histograms and normalized distributions were used to check relationships between multiple variables to make sure that data makes sense.
